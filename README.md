# TestPIWS
Utility to test connections to PI Web Services

TestPIWS is a WCF application that will read and write to a PI System (OSISoft, Inc) using the PITimeSeries.svc service.

To use this utility provide a known PI Server name and a valid wcf config file.

The config file that is generated by the compile process can be modified by replacing the contents of the system.serviceModel node with the same contents from the output.config file created by runnin svcutil.exe with the wsdl page address.
